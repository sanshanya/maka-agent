# Apache Maka source release runbook

This runbook prepares the official Apache Incubator source release. npm, Desktop, and other convenience artifacts use separate build, licensing, signing, and acceptance processes; they are not part of this source candidate or its release vote. Stable convenience artifacts, when provided, are built from the approved source release and tag.

The workflow implements release mechanics; it does not replace the human review of candidate provenance and release documents performed through the project's release vote.

## Candidate contract

- Archive: `apache-maka-<version>-incubating-src.tar.gz`
- Archive root: `apache-maka-<version>-incubating/`
- Checksum: `<archive>.sha512`
- Detached signature: `<archive>.asc`
- Staging directory: `<version>-incubating-rc<rc>/`
- Candidate tag: `v<version>-incubating-rc<rc>`

The RC number identifies a staging attempt and is not part of the archive name.
If any candidate byte changes, increment the RC number and restart the vote. Do
not replace files in a directory that has been presented for a vote.

The unsigned workflow handoff is identified by its exact source commit, not by
an RC number. Assign the RC identity only when creating the immutable candidate
tag and staging directory for the bytes selected by the Release Manager.

## Prerequisites

1. The intended version is committed to the root `package.json` on `main`.
2. Normal CI is green for the exact commit.
3. The PPMC and mentors have confirmed that provenance, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and
   `DISCLAIMER-WIP` are ready for an Incubator release vote.
4. The Release Manager has a public ASF-associated RSA PGP key whose actual
   signing key or subkey is at least 2048 bits and whose full fingerprint can be
   reviewed independently. New keys should be 4096-bit RSA.
5. The podling `KEYS` file contains that public key and is published from the
   Apache distribution area, not only from GitHub.

## Build and test an unsigned candidate

Run **Prepare ASF source candidate** from `main`, supplying the exact version.
The workflow:

1. builds the archive from the dispatched Git commit rather than the working
   tree;
2. generates and validates SHA-512;
3. checks the archive identity and required legal documents;
4. extracts the exact archive into a clean directory;
5. installs, audits, builds, type-checks, runs release checks, and tests from
   that extracted directory; and
6. uploads an unsigned workflow artifact for Release Manager handoff.

An equivalent unsigned archive can be created locally:

```sh
npm run release:asf:source -- \
  --version <version> \
  --revision <full-commit-sha>

npm run release:asf:verify -- \
  --artifact release/asf/apache-maka-<version>-incubating-src.tar.gz
```

Creation refuses to overwrite existing output. Remove or move a private local
attempt before rebuilding; never overwrite a staged or voted candidate.
Different gzip implementations may encode the same source tar payload into
different compressed bytes, so use the workflow artifact as the candidate that
will be signed rather than substituting a locally compressed archive.

Before opening the vote, create the candidate tag at the exact archived commit
and publish it through the normal reviewed Git process:

```sh
git tag -s v<version>-incubating-rc<rc> <full-commit-sha>
git verify-tag v<version>-incubating-rc<rc>
git show --no-patch --format=fuller v<version>-incubating-rc<rc>^{commit}
```

Pushing the tag is a separate authenticated maintainer action. Confirm its
target and signature before publishing it; the automation does not push tags.

## Sign locally

Never place a Release Manager's private PGP key in GitHub Actions or the
repository. Download the unsigned workflow artifact and its SHA-512 file onto
the Release Manager's machine. In a clean, trusted checkout containing the
verified candidate tag, run:

```sh
npm run release:asf:sign -- \
  --artifact <candidate-dir>/apache-maka-<version>-incubating-src.tar.gz \
  --key <full-pgp-fingerprint> \
  --revision v<version>-incubating-rc<rc>
```

The signing command first validates the downloaded SHA-512 and archive. It then
rebuilds the canonical uncompressed Git archive from the specified revision on
the Release Manager's hardware, isolated from repository-local, user, and system
Git attributes, and requires that source payload to be byte-for-byte identical
to the downloaded candidate after decompression. The original downloaded
candidate is then signed with SHA-512 after resolving the selected secret key to
the exact full fingerprint. Comparing the canonical payload avoids treating a
platform's gzip encoding as source identity. A workflow-produced digest alone
is not an independent trust check and is insufficient for signing.

Start from a reviewed copy of the current podling `KEYS` file, then append the
matching public key when needed:

```sh
(gpg --list-sigs <full-pgp-fingerprint> && gpg --armor --export <full-pgp-fingerprint>) >> KEYS
gpg --show-keys --with-fingerprint KEYS
```

Review the combined file before publishing it. Retain every key that has been
used to sign an Apache Maka release.

Verify the complete signed candidate in a temporary keyring populated only
from the reviewed `KEYS` file:

```sh
npm run release:asf:verify -- \
  --artifact <candidate-dir>/apache-maka-<version>-incubating-src.tar.gz \
  --keys <path-to-reviewed-KEYS>
```

Supplying `--keys` requires a detached signature. Verification rejects signing
keys or subkeys that are not RSA with at least 2048 bits, expired or revoked
keys and signatures, SHA-1 or any digest outside the accepted set, and bad or
missing signatures. SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512 signatures are accepted.

## Stage on Apache dist/dev

Release Managers need ASF commit access to the distribution repository. Check
out the podling development area, create a new immutable RC directory, and add
only the source archive, SHA-512 file, and detached signature:

```sh
svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/maka maka-dist-dev
mkdir maka-dist-dev/<version>-incubating-rc<rc>
cp apache-maka-<version>-incubating-src.tar.gz{,.sha512,.asc} \
  maka-dist-dev/<version>-incubating-rc<rc>/
svn add maka-dist-dev/<version>-incubating-rc<rc>
svn commit maka-dist-dev -m "Stage Apache Maka <version> incubating RC<rc>"
```

Publish or update `KEYS` at the podling distribution root through the same
reviewed ASF distribution process. Confirm the staged HTTPS URLs before sending
the vote email.

## Independent verification

Before casting a binding `+1`, every voter must download all signed source
packages and the published `KEYS` over HTTPS onto their own hardware, validate
ASF release-policy compliance and all cryptographic signatures, inspect the
archive, and compile/test the extracted source. Non-binding voters are strongly
encouraged to perform the same checks. Voters should record the commit, SHA-512,
signing-key fingerprint, platform, and commands used.

## Vote requirements

Both the podling and Incubator PMC review periods should normally remain open
for at least 72 hours. A shortened vote is only for exceptional expedited
releases; the vote email must explain why it is expedited, and the deviation
must be reported through the ASF process.

The podling vote passes only with at least three PPMC `+1` votes and more `+1`
than `-1` votes. After that result is summarized to the Incubator general list,
the release requires at least three Incubator PMC `+1` votes and more binding
`+1` than binding `-1` votes.

## Podling vote template

Send to `dev@maka.apache.org` and allow at least 72 hours.

```text
Subject: [VOTE] Release Apache Maka <version> (incubating) RC<rc>

Hello Apache Maka community,

This is a vote to release Apache Maka <version> (incubating), release candidate <rc>.

The source candidate:
<dist-dev-candidate-url>

The source commit:
<commit-url-and-full-sha>

The KEYS file:
<published-keys-url>

Please review and vote:
[ ] +1 Release this package
[ ]  0 No opinion
[ ] -1 Do not release this package (please provide the reason)

The vote will remain open for at least 72 hours.
```

After the podling vote passes, send a vote to
`general@incubator.apache.org`, linking the podling result and presenting the
same immutable candidate bytes. Apply the requirements above independently to
this Incubator PMC vote.

## Publish after approval

Only after both required votes pass, copy the exact approved files from the
development distribution area to the appropriate Apache release distribution
area, update the download page, and announce the release. Do not rebuild or
rename the approved archive during promotion.
