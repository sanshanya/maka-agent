/**
 * Renderer-side presentation rules that only Desktop has: which blocked reasons
 * are worth acting on, and what to offer after a turn fails.
 *
 * Separated from the React component layer so the rules can be unit-tested
 * without a DOM, mirroring the `session-health-notice.ts` pattern.
 *
 * Turning a `SessionStatus` into a label and a dot, and a `SessionBlockedReason`
 * into copy, is NOT here — both live in `@maka/ui`'s file of the same name,
 * which is also where the contract that a UI label never shows a raw enum
 * identifier is stated and enforced. This file used to re-export those and
 * document a tone matrix "consumed by both the SessionStatusIcon and the
 * chat-header status badge", naming two consumers that do not exist; the tone
 * layer and the re-exports are gone (#2984).
